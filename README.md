# Java Application with Gradle Build Management
# Project Overview
This project is a Java-based application that utilizes Gradle for build automation and dependency management. The project is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy customization, scalability, and maintainability. By using Gradle, the application streamlines the build process, ensuring that dependencies are managed efficiently and that the project can be built and deployed consistently across various environments.

# Features
The project leverages Gradle to automate the build process, simplifying the management of dependencies and tasks. The modular architecture of the application makes it adaptable and easy to extend with new features or components. This design approach ensures that the application can evolve over time, supporting future development needs. Gradle's powerful build system helps to maintain a clean and efficient workflow throughout the project's lifecycle.

# How to Run
To run the project, first build it by executing the appropriate Gradle commands. On Unix-based systems, use ./gradlew build, and on Windows, run gradlew.bat build. Once the build process is complete, you can run the application by executing the necessary tasks as defined in the build.gradle file. Ensure that all dependencies are properly configured in the gradle.properties file and that any other required configuration settings are in place.
